//Enter a year: 2024
2024 is a leap year.
Explanation:

We include the standard input/output library <stdio.h>.

We declare an integer variable year to store the input year.

We prompt the user to enter a year using printf and read it using scanf.

We check if the year is a leap year using the conditions explained earlier:

If (year % 4 == 0) is true, it means the year is a leap year, and we print that it is.
Otherwise, it's not a leap year, and we print that it's not.
